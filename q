   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThe name Einstein and the word genius have become almost synonymous ever since the theoretical physicist unveiled his theory of relativity. Combined with quantum mechanics, these form the basis of modern physics. Einstein is also responsible for perhaps the best known formula in history, E = mc2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.Albert Einstein was born on March 14th, 1879 in the German city of Ulm. His father Hermann was a salesman and engineer. A year after he was born, his family relocated to Munich where his father and uncle established an electrical equipment manufacturing company. This event in his early life may have set the stage for his interest in science and mathematics. His father would share his engineering knowledge with the young Albert who thrived on learning about how things worked.Albert[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s formal education began with him attending catholic schools even though he was of Jewish descent. His family did not actively practice the Jewish faith. Over the years his education was a varied one and he never hid his disdain for organized teaching. He attended several different institutions of learning in a number of locations.Einstein married a woman he had met at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. The marriage occurred about one year after he fathered a daughter by the woman. There is some mystery as to the fate of the baby. Some believe the girl may have been put up for adoption while others think she may have died after contracting scarlet fever while still an infant. The couple would have two sons before divorcing in 1919 after 16 years of marriage. Einstein would marry his cousin a few months later, after having begun a relationship with her 7 years prior.Einstein visited the United States for the first time in 1921 with New York City as his initial destination. He lectured and was celebrated in the country for three weeks. He also went to Washington D.C. during the trip and visited the White House while there. The following year, Einstein would begin touring Asia giving lectures in places such as Japan, Ceylon and Singapore. In Tokyo he would meet the Emperor and Empress of Japan at a reception in the Imperial Palace. His journey would then take him to Palestine, where he would come to appreciate his Jewish origins. Einstein emigrated to America in 1933, unhappy with the Nazi regime that had come to power in his native Germany. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940.Besides the theory of relativity, Einstein[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s contribution to science is unparalleled in its depth and magnitude. He was responsible for literally hundreds of article and books as well as collaborating with other scientists on numerous occasions.Einstein[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Annus-Mirabilas Papers of 1905 contained material relating to the theory of relativity, E = mc2, Brownian Motion and photoelectric effects. His Theory of Critical Opalescence publication explains, among other things, why the sky is blue. His Modern Quantum Theory was an upgrade to quantum theory and mechanics.Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955 at the age of 76. His death came as the result of an abdominal aortic aneurysm after he refused a potentially life-saving surgery. He explained he was ready to go and would prefer to do so in an elegant manner. Unbeknownst to his family, his brain was removed prior to his cremation in hopes of discovering the source of his pronounced intelligence.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

As a result, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in the field of Physics. Bohr was a promoter and philosopher of scientific research.Niels was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in October, 1885. He was the second born of three children. He went to Gammelhon Latin School and Copenhagen University. He majored in Physics under Professor Christian Christiansen who was the only Physics professor there at the time. Bohr also studied mathematics and astronomy.In 1905, Bohr conducted experiments from his father[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s lab at the university since his university did not have a physics lab. To carry out his experiments Bohr had to be his own glass blower, making test tubes with elliptical cross sections.Bohr worked on a theoretical piece regarding the absorption of alpha rays that was published in Philosophical Magazine in 1913. He introduced concepts that were borrowed from quantum theory.Bohr had an institute which served as a center for researchers who were interested in quantum mechanics or related fields in the 1920[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s and 1930[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s. In this period many of the world[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s best theoretical physicists spent time there. In 1922, Bohr won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on the structure of atoms and the radiation they emit. This award recognized his leading work in quantum mechanics.In 1930, Bohr began research on the composition of the atomic nucleus, their transmutations and their disintegrations. Bohr contributed majorly to clarifications of problems that were experienced in quantum physics.Bohr was married to Margethe in 1912 in a civil ceremony in the town hall. They had six children, all sons. He received a lot of accolades and honors in his lifetime and was also depicted on a banknote in 1997. Bohr died at the age of 77 in 1962, leaving behind a physics legacy.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mStephen Hawking was born on January 8th, 1942 in Oxford, England. From an early age he showed extensive interest in science and space. At age 21, while doing research on cosmology at the University of Cambridge, Hawking was diagnosed with incurable Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease; he was told that he only have 2 years left to live. The pioneering works and discoveries he has contributed in physics have transformed the definition of physics and offered breakthroughs to other scientists.Hawking has grown to be one of the most notable physicists the world has seen. His father, Frank Hawking, was a medical researcher. His mother, Isobel Hawking, was a scholar of philosophy, politics and economics. Both of his parents were graduates of Oxford University. Stephen Hawking[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s time in school was not as exceptional as one might have thought. He spent much of his time on quests outside the classroom. At the university, his love for mathematics overwhelmed him. Since Oxford did not offer a degree in mathematics he moved towards physics which was the perfect alternative. In 1962 he graduated from Oxford and went on to the University of Cambridge for his Ph.D.Stephen Hawking[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s studies mainly focused on laws that explain the universe. Together with Roger Penrose they showed the existence of Big Bang Singularity by applying Einstein[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s theory of relativity. From 1970 to 1974, he focused on black holes combining general relativity and quantum mechanics to come up with Hawking radiation theory that showed black holes emitted some form of radiation. In 1983, he joined hands with Jim Hurtle to further explain that the laws of science would reveal how the universe was formed since their research suggested that space and time had no edge. He has also published several books including A brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays, The Universe in a Nutshell and others.Professor Stephen Hawking is considered to be very resilient. He has been able to overcome his health challenges and, at the same time, contribute to physics at large. As such, he has received numerous awards, prizes and accolades. Among them include 12 honorary degrees, the Companion of Honor title, the Commander of the British Empire title and the most recent one; the Special Fundamental Physics Prize.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mIsaac Newton is considered one of the greatest scientists and physicists who ever lived. Newton invented a new kind of mathematics called calculus, discovered how light and color work and showed how gravity functions in the universe. Remarkably, he made these discoveries over a period of 18 months, between 1665 and 1667.Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England on December 25th, 1642. He went to Grantham grammar school, but he was more interested in making mechanical models than he was in studying and was considered a poor student. His boyish hobbies led to a small windmill that could grind corn and wheat, a water clock and a sundial. Newton left school when he was 14 because his widowed mother needed him to help with their farm. He was no better at this than he was at being a schoolboy and he was eventually sent back to school.Newton entered Trinity College at Cambridge University in 1661. Here again he was a mediocre student. He left school in 1665 without distinction, but returned in 1667 as a fellow. In 1669 he became professor of mathematics and gave lectures on geometry, astronomy, optics and mathematics. He later quit and went to work for the government and was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1672.Newton claimed that he began to think about a theory of gravity while he was drinking tea one afternoon and saw an apple fall from a tree. This made him realize that the same force that made the apple fall is what keeps the moon in its orbit. He extrapolated from this to realize that gravity makes every pair of bodies in the universe attracted each other. He also learned that the strength of gravity depends on the amount of matter in the bodies being attracted and the distance between the bodies.Newton also showed why the apple might fall straight to earth while the moon moved in a circle around the earth. He showed that the moon was falling constantly toward the earth and if it moved in a straight line, it would fly out of its orbit. In 1684, Edmund Halley, the English astronomer, urged Newton to publish his findings on gravity. In 1687 Newton[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s discoveries were published in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Even today this book is considered one of the great scientific books of all time.In 1704, Newton published Optiks. In this book, he explained why bodies appear to be colored. This laid the foundation for spectrum analysis, which allows scientists to determine the temperature, chemical composition and speed of bodies like distant stars. Newton also discovered that sunlight is a mix of light of all colors while passing sunlight through a prism.Interestingly, Newton did not spend too much time studying math, physics or astronomy. He was fascinated by alchemy and theology, and was so sensitive to criticism that he had to be urged by his friends to even publish his work. Yet, Albert Einstein claimed that he could not have done what he did without Newton[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s discoveries.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mNikola Tesla was a Serbian-American electrical engineer and physicist. He invented the alternating current induction motor.Tesla was born on July 10th, 1856 in Smiljan, which was then a part of Austria-Hungary and is now part of Croatia. Tesla[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox religion. Tesla was given a technical education in Graz and at the Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague. Tesla came down with a very severe case of cholera in 1873 and his father promised that he would send Nikola to the top engineering school if he recuperated. Originally, Tesla[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s father wanted him to become a priest.Tesla[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s higher education was irregular. He dropped out of the Austrian Polytechnic, and though he attended classes at the university, he never formally enrolled there. After that, Tesla worked for the Budapest Telephone Exchange as an electrician.Tesla moved to France and then to the United States in 1884, where he began working for Thomas Edison. He quit when Edison didn[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019t pay him enough for hard-won improvements to the company[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s generators and motors. After 1900, Tesla devoted himself to independent research at his own laboratories; one on Fifth Avenue in New York City and the other on Houston Street.Even as a student Tesla was inventive. He created a motor that did not need a commutator to function. A commutator is a device that switches the direction of a current in some generators or motors that run on electricity. Tesla invented a motor with coils that were arranged so that when alternating current energized them they cast a magnetic field that rotated at a predetermined speed. Tesla patented this rotating field motor in 1888. Fortunately, he was able to sell it at a time when the advocates of alternating current were in the market for such a motor. Tesla sold his patent to George Westinghouse.Tesla also made advances with frequency apparatuses and high voltage. He invented the Tesla coil, a system of arc lighting, a generator for high frequency currents, a system for wireless transmission and a high potential magnifying transmitter. The magnifying transmitter was a machine that could produce millions of electrical volts that manifested in long, spectacular arcs. Tesla formed his own company not long after leaving Edison with money from several investors. He held at least 278 patents.Tesla also made advances in radio transmission, but fell into patent troubles with Marconi. He also had troubles with another backer, J. P. Morgan, who promised to pay for Tesla[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Wardenclyffe Tower wireless broadcasting experiment. The tower was never properly used and was demolished in 1917.Tesla spent the last part of his life in a series of hotel rooms, and he died on January 7, 1943 in a room at the New Yorker. Though he had made a lot of money over his lifetime, he died in poverty.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mMarie Curie was born Maria Sklodowska to two teachers in Poland. Because her parents were involved in Polish nationalism, they were oppressed by the Russian authorities, which ran Poland at the time. Marie[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s father was forced to stop giving lab instruction to his students and hence was forced to bring his lab equipment to his home. There he encouraged his children, including Marie, to use it.Marie was a brilliant student and wished to teach, but she could not enroll in college because she was a woman. She and her sister Bronislawa founded a secret school called the Flying University, which admitted girls and, somewhat more dangerously, taught a curriculum that was decidedly pro-Polish. Marie Curie was always fiercely proud of her Polish heritage, even when she lived in France. She made sure that her daughters learned the Polish language.Eventually, after a time of hardship, Marie came to Paris to study physics, mathematics and chemistry at the Sorbonne. Her hardships did not end when she moved to Paris, and she took tutoring jobs to make ends meet. She earned her physics degree in 1893 and a math degree in 1894.Soon after this Marie was introduced to Pierre Curie, who taught at the School of Physics and Chemistry. They were married in 1895. Marie was reluctant at first because she had always planned to return to Poland, but Pierre claimed that he would move to Poland with her. Marie returned briefly to Poland but could not get a job at an institute of higher education because of her gender. She returned to Paris both to pursue her career and to be with Pierre.The year after her marriage, French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity and the Curies became interested in the radiation emitted by natural substances. Marie and Pierre worked together to investigate these properties.The Curies discovered that uranium ore had much more radioactivity than could be accounted for by the uranium alone. Marie and Pierre extracted small amounts of very radioactive new chemical elements from uranium ore. They named these new elements radium and polonium after Marie[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s country of birth. In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Becquerel. This award made Marie Curie the first person of her gender to win the Nobel Prize. Additionally, she is so far the only woman who has won in both physics and chemistry.Pierre died in 1906. At the time he was a professor at the Sorbonne and Marie was appointed as a professor in his place. She was also instrumental in founding the Radium Institute in Paris and was its first director. During World War I, she and her eldest daughter Irene, who was only 17 at the time, brought a mobile radiographic unit to the front. After the war Irene served as her mother[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s assistant in the Radium Institute. Marie Curie died in 1934 of aplastic anemia, a disease where the bone marrow and stem cells of the blood are destroyed. The disease was a consequence of her unprotected exposure to radiation. She was first buried at Sceaux and then her body was moved to the Pantheon in Paris.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

In 1892, he received the title of Baron Kelvin of Largs. He was the first scientist in the United Kingdom to join the House of Lords. He did much to unify the science of physics, which was just beginning to come into its own during the Victorian era.Lord Kelvin invented the mirror galvanometer used in cable signaling and the siphon recorder, which was used to received the signals. An avid seaman, he also invented the first ship[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s compass that was free of the magnetic influence of any iron on the ship. He also invented a mechanism that predicted the tide. This was useful to predict the variations in sea level in any port. He also suggested that gas thermometers be used for accurate temperature readings, and a thermometer scale is named after him. On the Kelvin thermometer scale, absolute zero is equal to [1;35m\u[0m[31m2013 273 degrees Celsius. Absolute zero is where molecular movement ceases.Lord Kelvin was born William Thomson on June 26th, 1824 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. His father[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s job as a mathematics professor in Glasgow made it possible for William and his siblings to travel and study in London, Paris, Germany and Holland.

As a teenager Thomson wrote essays and even published scientific papers.Thomson entered Cambridge University in 1841 where he enjoyed an active life as a student. He participated in many activities, but science was his great love. He graduated four years later. He was a Second Wrangler, which was the second highest ranked undergraduate degree in math. He was also named a fellow of his house and worked in the laboratory of the famous scientists Henri Regnault in Paris. At around this same time the University of Glasgow elevated Thomson to the chair of natural philosophy. He was only 22 years old.Thomson held the chair of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow until his retirement in 1899, over a half century later. In 1893 Thomson was the head of a commission created to design the power station at Niagara Falls. Though he was at first determined to use direct current to power it, he was impressed by fellow physicist Nikola Tesla[1;35m\u[0m[31m2018s embrace of alternating current.Lord Kelvin published at least 661 papers on a variety of scientific subjects and held over 70 patents. He died on December 17, 1907 and was interred in Westminster Abbey.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mRichard was a theoretical physicist who made major contribution in physics. He was born on May 11th, 1918 in Manhattan, New York, United States. He studied at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he obtained his Bachelor of Science in 1939. From an early age he was influenced by his father to challenge orthodox thinking and this contributed to his love for the study of Physics.Richard attended the Far Rockaway High School. When he was 15, he taught himself advanced algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, infinite series, as well as integral and differential calculus. Before joining college, he was already recreating mathematical models and experimenting with them. He won the New York Math Championship in his last year in high school. After studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he went on to learn more at Princeton University.After completing his PhD in 1942, Richard became an assistant physics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After the WWII and his participation in the Manhattan Project, he joined Cornell University where he taught physics in the period from 1945 to 1950. In his later years, he joined the California Institute of Technology as a professor due to his love for teaching. Throughout his academic career, he gained the reputation of being a [1;35m\u[0m[31m201Cgreat explainer[1;35m\u[0m[31m201D due to his ability to clarify complex concepts in a simple way.Richard Feynman participated in the Manhattan project while at Princeton. This was the U.S. wartime project involving the development of the atomic bomb. Though he was a junior physicist, and was therefore not central to the project, his input was immense as he was made a group leader. His main task was in the theoretical division where he led the computation group in the human computers division. He also calculated neutron equations for a small reactor in the project in order to measure how close to criticality an assembly of fissile material was.This is the theory for which he won the Nobel Prize due to its accurate predictions. He started working on the theory as an undergraduate and advanced it in his later years at Cornell. His work under this theory consisted of two distinct formulations. The first one was his Path Integral Formulation and the second was his formulation of the Feynman Diagrams.Richard developed a weak decay model which showed that the current coupling in the decay process is a combination of axial and vector currents. Though his theory was developed around the same time as that of Robert Marshak and E. C. George Sudarshan, his theory was seminal as it neatly explained the weak interaction by the axial and vector currents. Together with the 1933 beta decay theory, the combination of the two theories explained parity violation.Richard came up with a quantum-mechanical explanation for this observation of helium as it displays a total lack of viscosity when flowing. He applied the Schrodinger equation which showed that helium was displaying a quantum mechanical behavior which is observable to the naked eye.Richard Feynman passed away February 15th, 1988 at the age of 69 leaving behind an incredible legacy in physics.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mErnest Rutherford was a Nobel Prize winning famous physicist who was born in New Zealand in 1871. He was the son of a Scottish-born father and English-born mother. He was a bright student at school and won a scholarship to the University of New Zealand. There he graduated with Arts and Science degrees, and then won a scholarship to the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University in 1895.He had a distinguished spell at Cavendish where he pioneered new techniques in the detection of radio waves and made discoveries about the structure of atoms and the nature of radiation. He moved to Montreal, Canada in 1898 when he was appointed to a teaching post at McGill University. Two years later, he married his long time fianc[1;35m\u[0m[31m00E9 Mary Newton. In 1907, he returned to Britain when he was appointed Professor of Physics at Manchester University.In 1917, he returned to the Cavendish Laboratory when he was appointed Professor of Physics. He held this position until his death in 1937. During his tenure of the physics chair at the Cavendish, the Laboratory went through an astonishingly productive period in research physics with many of his staff becoming recipients of Nobel Prizes.During his initial time at the Cavendish, Rutherford was nurtured by the physics professor J.J. Thomson. When he moved to Canada, he carried on his research in radiation, and discovered the difference between alpha and beta radiation. He was also the first physicist to realize that atoms could change from one element to another as a result of decay through radioactivity. Rutherford discovered that elements have a half-life. This is a time period during which a quantity of a radioactive element will diminish or decay by 50%. In recognition of this groundbreaking work, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1908. Somewhat bizarrely, the Nobel foundation awarded him the chemistry rather than the physics prize.In 1911, while working in Manchester, Rutherford was experimenting on the effects of firing particles at various substances. His experiments showed that when firing alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil, most of the particles passed through the sheet. However, some were bounced back. This led Rutherford to propose that the bounced particles must be colliding with objects of high mass. He concluded that atoms must have a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged, less dense electrons and he proposed a new theory about the structure of an atom.Perhaps Rutherford is best known to the public as the first man to split an atom. This is strictly incorrect, because atoms are split during chemical reactions. In his experiments in radioactive decay, Rutherford had already recognized that atoms may split spontaneously. What Rutherford actually managed to do in 1932 was split the nucleus deliberately.Rutherford received many awards and honors during his lifetime. In 1931, he was given the title [1;35m\u[0m[31m201CBaron Rutherford of Nelson.[1;35m\u[0m[31m201D When he died in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey, where Newton is also buried, an honor awarded to only the most distinguished scientists.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mGuglielmo Marconi was born on April 25th, 1874 in Bologna, Italy. His father was an affluent Italian land owner named Giuseppe Marconi. Marconi was first taught privately by Leghorn and Florence at Bologna. He then joined the University of Bologna. As early as 1890, his interest in physics, especially on wireless network communication, became quite evident. He studied the early mathematical works of Clerk Maxwell, the experiments of Heinrich Hertz and a research on lightning and electricity by Sir Oliver Lodge.Guglielmo Marconi made quite remarkable advancements that impact us to this day. His inventions and discoveries helped to create the radio, television and radar of today. Marconi believed that communication among people was possible through a wireless radio signal. His determination in this field brought about his greatest successes.In late 1894, Marconi began conducting experiments in his father[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s home in Pontecchio, Italy, inspired by the knowledge he had gained by studying Heinrich[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s research. He applied Hertzian waves in his experiments to transmit messages over short distances, wirelessly. He essentially improved Hertz[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s invention. Marconi progressively increased the distance between the points for signal reception and transmission to relatively longer distances. It is also during this period that he performed simple experiments that involved the use of reflectors to concentrate radiated electrical energy.As early as the summer of 1895, Marconi accomplished a signal reception and transmission distance of approximately 1.25 miles. It is interesting to note that the success of his tries were signified by waving a white handkerchief. This advanced to the need for a firing a gun as the distances increased.In 1896, he took his apparatus to England where he was introduced to the engineer in chief of the post office, Sir. William Preece. Later in the year, Marconi was granted a patent for his successful creation of a wireless telegraph. This motivated him to form his own company in 1897.Marconi successfully proved that wireless waves were not affected by the earth[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s curvature. Obsessed with the idea of sending messages across long distances, Marconi built a giant powerful transmitter in late 1901 to transmit the first wireless signals across the Atlantic, between Newfoundland and Cornwall; a distance of over 2,100 miles.He managed to successfully send and receive signals across the Atlantic and the news of this achievement spread across the world. The majority of other outstanding scientist, including Thomas Edison, applauded Marconi. This achievement disapproved the dominant believe that the earth[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s curvature affected the transmission of wireless signals. As a result, Marconi received many honors including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1909.Guglielmo Marconi was appointed as a Lieutenant in the Italian Army in 1914 and later as a captain and commander in the Navy. In 1919, he received an Italian military medal for his war service. During his service in the military, Marconi continued with his experiments establishing the world[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s first radiotelephone link in 1932 and later a microwave beacon for ship navigation. On July 20th, 1937, Marconi died following a series of heart attacks.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mMax Planck was a famous theoretical physicist who was born in 1858, in Kiel, Germany. He originated the quantum theory and it completely changed human understanding of not only atomic processes, but also subatomic processes. In 1918, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics.Planck[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s father was a professor at the University of Kiel, and later at the University of G[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6ttingen. He was from a very traditional, intellectual family. His paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were theology professors. Planck studied at the Universities of Berlin and Munich. His teachers included Helmholtz and Kirchhoff, and he completed his doctorate of philosophy in 1879. The physicist married Marie Merck in 1887 and they had four children. After Marie died in 1909, he married Marga von H[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6sslin, Marie[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s cousin. In Munich, he was Privatdozent from 1880 to 1885, and then at Kiel, he was an associate professor of theoretical physics, until 1889. He then succeeded Kirchhoff as professor at the Berlin University, and he remained there until he retired in 1926. Soon after, he became the president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and he held this position until 1937. His earliest work was on thermodynamics, a pursuit he acquired when he studied under Kirchhoff. He published several papers on entropy, thermoelectricity and also on the dilute solutions theory. He was also interested in radiation processes and believed they should be regarded as electromagnetic. After these studies he started working on the problems of energy distribution. Planck concluded that there was a relationship between the frequency of radiation and energy. In 1900, he published his conclusions about the relationship which was founded on the revolutionary idea that energy that was released by a resonator would only take on quanta, or discrete values. This was his most important work and it marked an huge milestone in physics history. The significance of this finding had far-reaching effects on physics, but it was not highly valued at first. The data for its validity progressively became overwhelming because its application took into account many inconsistencies between recognized phenomena and classical theory. His quantum theory work was produced in the journal, Annalen der Physik. Planck[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s work was published in two books which include the Thermodynamik and the Theorie der W[1;35m\u[0m[31m00E4rmestrahlung. In 1926, Planck was elected to the Royal Society[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Foreign Membership. In 1928, he was given a medal from the Royal Society[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Copley.He faced a very troubling time and tragic period when the Nazi government was in power. Planck believed it was his duty to stay in Germany but he was very opposed to a number of the government[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s policies, in particular their policies towards the Jews. During the last weeks of World War II his home was bombed and completely destroyed.He also suffered a personal loss when his son, Erwin, was executed for his participation in the failed assassination attempt of Hitler in July, 1944. In October of 1947, Planck died in G[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6ttingen.

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mAlessandro Volta was an Italian physicist. He was especially active in pioneering the scientific study of electricity, and the volt is named in his honor. Volta was also the first scientist to produce a working battery, which he referred to as a [1;35m\u[0m[31m201Cvoltaic pile.[1;35m\u[0m[31m201D He remains highly regarded in his native land, and his image has been used on both stamps and currency.Volta was born in the northern town of Como, Italy on February 18, 1745. His childhood was unremarkable, and his first job of real note did not come until 1774, when he was appointed as professor of physics in his home town[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Royal School. The following year, he produced a highly successful device which created static electricity, drawing on the previous works of the Swedish scientist Johan Wilcke. Volta energetically promoted his improved device, to the extent that many people believed he had originated the very concept.Volta then became interested in gas chemistry, discovering methane in an Italian lake in November 1776 and successfully isolating it two years later. He had been inspired to search for the gas after reading a paper written by the American polymath, Benjamin Franklin. Volta also set up experiments in which methane, while held in a sealed container, could be set alight by means of a spark of electricity.Volta was a pioneer in the study of what is now known as capacitance. His work was instrumental in the scientific community[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s choice of the term [1;35m\u[0m[31m201Cvolt[1;35m\u[0m[31m201D for the now well-known unit of electrical charge. In 1779, he was appointed to the University of Pavia[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s chair in experimental physics. He was to remain in this post for more than two decades. While there, he married his wife, Teresa, and the couple had three sons together.He became interested in the experiments that Luigi Galvani was carrying out with frogs, which showed that they could both conduct and detect electricity. Volta tried replicating the experiment with paper soaked in brine, rather than frogs[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019 legs, and was able to detect the flow of electricity in this way as well. From this he discovered the law by which electromotive force is determined by the difference between the potentials of two electrodes.In 1800, Volta and Galvani had a quarrel regarding one of Galvani[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s theories. To help show that he was in the right, Volta developed his [1;35m\u[0m[31m201Cvoltaic pile,[1;35m\u[0m[31m201D which was able to output an electric current on a steady basis. This was the first modern battery. While experimenting to discover the best pair of metals to use for his electrodes, Volta settled upon silver and zinc. The finished voltaic pile saw the electrodes pressed against brine-soaked cardboard, although early versions of the battery had the brine placed into goblets.Volta[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s battery, although effective, was not suitable for general use in the long term. This was partly because of its reliance on sulfuric acid, a highly dangerous and corrosive substance. Nevertheless, his achievement saw him ennobled by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801. In 1819, Volta decided to retire from active science, spending the remainder of his days living quietly on his country estate in Camnago. He died at home on March 5, 1827. A museum by Lake Como commemorates Volta[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s life and works.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mJ.J. Thomson was a brilliant British physicist who was born in Manchester, United Kingdom in December, 1856. He developed an interest in science from a very early age and showed remarkable talent as a pupil. He benefited from education in private schools, and was clever enough to be accepted into Owens College when he was only 14.Upon leaving Owens College, he was accepted into Cambridge University in 1876, where he enrolled in Trinity College. He studied mathematics there, graduating with a first class honors BA in 1880. He had the second highest marks awarded in that year, and he was awarded the Smith[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Prize. He continued studying and received his MA degree in 1883, winning the Adam[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Prize. He was appointed Professor of Physics at the famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University in 1884. His skills as an inspirational teacher came to the fore, and during his time in charge, no less than seven of the staff under him won Nobel Prizes. Thomson himself would also win a Nobel Prize in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on electrical conduction in gases. He lived to see his son also win a Nobel Prize in 1937.Before Thomson[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s discovery of the electron, physicists had long suspected that the atom was made up of smaller particles. However, the general belief was that the smallest components could not be any smaller than the hydrogen atom. In 1897, Thomson proposed that the atomic particles were up to 1,000 times smaller than the hydrogen atom. He drew this conclusion as a result of his experiments with different types of rays. He devised an ingenious method to calculate the mass of rays under various influences and discovered their mass was significantly less than that of a hydrogen atom. Thomson[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s breakthrough was to remove the air from the discharge tubes, thereby reducing the pressure. He also discovered that the mass remained constant regardless of what atom was used. He concluded from his research that an atom was composed of negatively charged particles. He called them corpuscles, but the scientific community preferred to call them electrons.Thomson is credited with the invention of mass spectrometry. This is a method of deflecting rays using electrical and magnetic forces, and capturing the deflection on photographic plates. During experiments with neon gas, Thomson was able to show that there were two different deflection paths, meaning that neon was composed of two different atomic masses. In other words, there were two isotopes of neon. This was the first proof of isotopes existing in stable elements.Apart from his Nobel Prize, Thomson received many honors. He was made a knight in 1908, and four years later was granted the Order of Merit, an award that had been introduced four years earlier to recognize distinguished service in a number of areas, including science. When he died in 1940, he was further honored by being buried in Westminster Abbey, alongside Isaac Newton and one of Thomson[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s most brilliant former students, Ernest Rutherford.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mErwin Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger was a famous Austrian theoretical physicist that contributed to our current understanding of physics. He was a highly educated man and the only son of parents that valued education. He dabbled in botany and painting when he was a young man. Once he started studying at the university, he came under the influence of Friedrich Hasenh[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6rl. The work he did with his mentor during this time in his career would turn out to be the foundation to a great deal of his later work. After Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger received his PhD he became part of the faculty at the University of Vienna.Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger was in the Italian artillery during World War I. His mentor Hasenh[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6rl died in the war. When Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger went up to receive the Nobel Prize in 1933, he said that if it was not for the war, his mentor would have been the one to receive the honor.After getting married and moving from one position to another, Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger was recruited to be the head of the physics department at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. This was the most productive point of his career. During this time, he read a footnote in one of Albert Einstein[1;35m\u[0m[31m2018s works which sparked his interest in wave mechanics.This is when the physicist started to explore the idea of a wave when it comes to the movement of an electron in an atom. He published work about this. His idea in the publication quickly became known by the name Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Wave Equation. The academic world was chiefly divided between two publications, Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s own and that of Werner Heisenberg. Unlike Heisenberg[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s, Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s theory could be visualized. However, the physicist himself put a stop to this rift when he proved that both were identical, simply expressed in different ways.Schrodinger[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s equation is part of his enduring legacy when it comes to technical contributions to the field. In his later years, he produced interesting philosophical questions related to the field of mathematics and physics.Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger was offered the prestigious position of Max Planck, a physicists who had already changed the way people thought about the field with his groundbreaking theories on quantum dynamics and thermal radiation. He moved to Berlin in 1972 to take on the post. Despite making some great strides in his career, Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger was hesitant to take the offer at first, uneasy about moving to a big city from the picturesque Alps. The move turned out to be a wonderful one for him.He won the Nobel Prize in 1933 with Paul A.M Dirac. That same year, Hitler came to power in Germany and Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger decided that it was time to go to England. He had an Oxford University Fellowship for a while and received an offer from Princeton University. He ultimately turned it down. Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger returned to his native country for a little while after he was offered a post at University of Graz. However, because he had left Germany, he was seen as an enemy. Schr[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6dinger spent the last years of his working career in Dublin. He spent the last years of his life working and publishing papers.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mWerner Heisenberg was born on December 5th, 1901 in Wurzburg, Germany. His father, Dr. August Heisenberg, was a professor of Greek Philology. Heisenberg started schooling in a primary school in Wurzburg before moving with his father to Munich in 1910. He joined the Maximillian School for his secondary school studies until 1920 when he joined the University of Munich to study physics under the supervision of scientists like Sommerfeld, Wien and Rosenthal. During the winter of 1922 to 1923, Heisenberg attended the Georg-August-Universit[1;35m\u[0m[31m00E4t G[1;35m\u[0m[31m00F6ttingen where he studied physics under Max Born and David Hilbert.Werner Heisenberg was a German theoretical physicist whose work in science led to his overwhelming popularity. His influence on contemporary physics ranks alongside other famous scientist like Richard Feynman, Paul Dirac and Niels Bohr.Heisenberg[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s work with matrix mechanics was one of the first and most useful formulations that led to his discovery of quantum mechanics in 1925. During this time he wrote more than 600 research papers, explanations and philosophical essays based on his discoveries in matrix mechanics. However, his discovery was abstract in nature and difficult for many people to visualize. His writings on matrix mechanics are still available for reading as collected works.It was through the discovery of matrix mechanics that Heisenberg formulated quantum mechanics. This is a type of mathematics in physics that measures the interaction of atomic and subatomic systems with radiation. Heisenberg measured their interaction based on observable quantities such as momentum, energy, angular momentum and position.In 1932, this German theoretical physicist was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, a prize attributed to his creation of quantum mechanics. In spite of difficult political and economical problems, Germany became the leading country in quantum mechanics in the 1920[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s courtesy of Heisenberg. The creation of quantum mechanics led to, among other things, the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen.Heisenberg unveiled his uncertainty principle in 1927. The uncertainty principle, also known as an indeterminacy principle, was one of Heisenberg[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s earliest breakthroughs. His uncertainty principle states that the more accurately one can determine the location of a particle, the less precisely its momentum can be determined. The converse is also found to be true.Heisenberg played a vital role in reviving German science after years of war. In his later years, he assumed influential positions in Germany and abroad. He gave lectures on theoretical physics and other subjects. He succumbed to cancer of the gall bladder and kidneys on February 1st, 1976 at the age of 74.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mJames Chadwick was a British Nobel Prize-winning physicist. He received the honor in 1935 for his discovery of the neutron. Later in his career, Chadwick was most prominent as the leader of the British team that assisted with the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic weapon during World War Two. He was awarded a knighthood at the end of the war.Chadwick was born in Manchester, England on October 20th, 1891. After a promising but unexceptional career at school, he managed to gain a place at the city[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Victoria University to study physics. This was, in fact, the result of a mistake on the part of the admissions board, since Chadwick had shown more of an interest in mathematical study. His shyness and lack of confidence as a young man prevented him from confronting the university about the error, and he took a degree in physics, graduating successfully in 1911. He then undertook postgraduate research, sometimes working alongside the renowned Ernest Rutherford.While at the university[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s department of physics, Chadwick became acquainted with scientists of the caliber of Hans Geiger and Niels Bohr, among the foremost physicists of their day. He spent his time developing the planetary theory of the atom, and had achieved a Master[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s degree by 1913. For his work, he was given the Exhibition Scholarship, which had been set up after the Great Exhibition of 1851.Chadwick used the funds that this brought to go to study in Germany at the country[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s first specialized research institution near Berlin. Here, Geiger was his ultimate superior, an arrangement which suited Chadwick very well. His own research brought advances such as knowledge of the energy range of beta particles, something which Wolfgang Pauli later used to help develop his own theory that the particle, now known as the neutrino, must exist.During World War One, Chadwick worked in Ruhleben, in a camp set up for German civilians. After the war ended, he took up a post at Cambridge University, in the world famous Cavendish Laboratory. Here, he renewed his partnership with Rutherford, and produced pioneering experiments that allowed the electrical charge of a nucleus to be determined directly. In 1922, he was appointed as director of research, working directly under Rutherford himself. The two men worked closely as they attempted to turn one element into another by means of splitting the nucleus.By analyzing the irregularities that they found in their results, Chadwick and Rutherford came to realize that each element had its own specific atomic number and mass. They also found that the latter was always higher than the former. Rutherford[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s theory was that this could be caused by neutrally-charged particles with the mass of a single proton. However, the duo was unable to show the existence of any such particle, and the hypothesis was dropped.Eventually, Chadwick performed an experiment in which nitrogen was subjected to radiation, producing a substantial amount of energy as a result. He demonstrated that this result could only have been produced by the coming together of uncharged particles, each with about the mass of a proton. For discovering these particles, which he dubbed neutrons, he won his Nobel Prize. In the 1940[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s he worked extensively on the Manhattan Project and attended the first nuclear test in New Mexico. After WWII he worked for the United Kingdom[1;35m\u[0m[31m2019s Atomic Energy Authority, retiring in 1962. He died in Cambridge in July, 1974.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m]
